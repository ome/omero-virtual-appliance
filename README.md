Building an OMERO Virtual Appliance
===================================

**Note that the Virtual Appliance has been discontinued, OMERO 5.2.1 is the last version available.**

The purpose of these scripts is to automate the process of building an OMERO 
virtual machine.

1. Prerequisites:
	- A Linux or Mac OS X operating system
	- A recent and working VirtualBox install

2. Retrieve the OMERO Virtual Appliance scripts by cloning this repository:

    ````
    $ git clone https://github.com/ome/omero-virtual-appliance
    ````
	
3. Environment Setup:

	See the [virtual appliance user documentation](
	http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/omero5.1/users/virtual-appliance.html)
	
	Place the VDI in your VirtualBox harddisk directory. On Mac OS X this should be `$HOME/Library/VirtualBox/HardDisks/` and on Linux `$HOME/.VirtualBox/HardDisks/`
	
	The OMERO virtual appliance script will look in these locations for the VDI to kick start the virtual appliance building process.

4. Run the virtual appliance build script to build a virtual appliance named omero-vm:

	```
	$ bash omerovm.sh omero-vm
	```

5. This should take roughly 8-15 minutes to complete depending upon your machine.

6. When you see the message "All Done!" you should be able to either:
 	1. Start an OMERO client such as OMERO.insight and connect to your virtual appliance
 	2. SSH into your virtual appliance using the IP address printed at the end of the build script
	3. Use the utility script connect.sh to open a shell into your vm named omero-vm:

		```
		$ bash connect.sh omero-vm
		```

Utility Scripts
===============

A number of utility scripts are included to enable you to easily start, stop, and connect to your virtual appliance:

- [connect.sh](connect.sh): To get a shell on a named OMERO virtual appliance, supplying the name of the virtual appliance that you wish to connect to:

  ```
  $ bash connect.sh omero-vm
  ```

- [start.sh](start.sh) - To start a stopped OMERO virtual appliance, supply the name of virtual appliance you wish to run:

  ```
  $ bash start.sh omero-vm
  ```

- [stop.sh](stop.sh) - To stop a started OMERO virtual appliance, supply the name of virtual appliance you wish to halt:

  ```
  $ bash stop.sh omero-vm
  ```


- [setup_port_forwarding.sh](setup_port_forwarding.sh) - To automatically set up port forwarding settings for the nominated virtual appliance in VirtualBox: 

  ```
  $ bash setup_port_forwarding.sh omero-vm
  ```
